        <h2>What should I do when someone answers my question?</h2>
        <ol>Decide if the answer is helpful, and then...
            <li>Vote on it. Vote up answers that are helpful and well-researched, and vote down answers that are not. Other users will also vote on answers to your question.</li>
            <li>Accept it. As the writer of the question, you have a special privilege: you may accept the answer that you believe is the best solution to your problem.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please do not add a comment on your question or on an answer to say "Thank you". Comments are meant for requesting clarification, leaving constructive criticism, or adding relevant but minor additional information â€“ not for socializing. If you want to say "thank you," vote on or accept that person's answer, or simply pay it forward by providing a great answer to someone else's question.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h2>What does it mean when an answer is "accepted"?</h2>
        <p>When a user receives a good answer to their question, that user has the option to "accept" an answer.</p>
        <p>Accepting an answer is not meant to be a definitive and final statement indicating that the question has now been answered perfectly. It simply means that the author received an answer that worked for them personally. Not every user comes back to accept an answer, and of those who do, they might not change the accepted answer even if a newer, better answer comes along later.</p>
